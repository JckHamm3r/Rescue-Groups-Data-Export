# Rescue-Groups-Data-Export
Script for exporting animal data from rescuegroups.org


I created this because the rescuegroups api documentation was confusing and difficult to navigate.
This script will export all animal data from your account, but if you don't want all of the fields, you can cut the field list down to just the ones you are interested in.
